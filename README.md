Lab 6: 

Point light: illuminates entirely around a point. Rotation doesn’t matter, while position does.
Directional light: provides ambient light in a particular direction. Position doesn’t matter, while rotation does.
Spotlight: Is a… well, spotlight, with both position and rotation mattering to illuminate the cone.
Area light: is a baked light source that illuminates everything on one side of a square plane.

The first photo is of the backside of a dualshock 4, the second photo is it zoomed in. The third is a color modification I did to make it resemble an appropriate normal map, and the last photo is how it turned out!

For the textures, I just look up “cool textures”. One looks like a painting, the other like a marbled ink splot.

I also made a basic, weird, purple skybox!

I followed the tutorial (for the most part) and modified the materials on some objects.

I made the cubes by following the assignment's instructions. I made the fifth cube my modulo-ing
the vUv. That was... rough.

The answer for A and B are basically the same. You take it, 
multiply it by 8, and round down to the nearest whole number. 
White.

The top cube's shader was done by messing around with the variables in fragShader.
Everything else was done as the tutorial specified.
